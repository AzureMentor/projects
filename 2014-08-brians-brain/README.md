It's been a long time since we've done any cellular automata, so tonight we'll be building Brian's Brain: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain

It makes for really pretty pictures, and if it gets too easy we'll Buckaroo Banzai it and jump into the 8th Dimension. Should be tons of fun!

Special guest appearance by Brian Silverman, creator of Brian's Brain!
