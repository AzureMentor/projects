== The Challenge
build a system that
takes a set of ranked ballots
and apply one of a number of "ways of coming up with"
1 winner to go into the hall of fame

== The Methods
easy - Borda Count
harder - take out 1 candidate with each round, and redistribute
	 Single transferable votes - 
	 Coombs method


==MISSION
a voting system for football players, who are being voted into the Hall of Fame

==BACKGROUND (from dann)
In honor of voting day and the start of the world cup we'll be putting on our psephologist hats and building a voting system for the football hall of fame!

We'll be mostly looking at ranked ballot[0] styles of voting, but if you have a different favorite you can try that too. In particular we'll implement the Borda count[1], STV[2], Coombs' method[3], and Instant-runoff[4]. We'll look at whether we have a Condorcet winner for a particular set of ballots[5], and check the Banzhaf power index[6]. (And maybe random ballot methods! [7])
